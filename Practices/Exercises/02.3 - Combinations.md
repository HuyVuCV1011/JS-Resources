> ### 1. Perfect Number
A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of it divisors. Number because the sum of the proper divisors in each case is equal to the number; the proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, and 3, and their sum is 6.(496)
```js
isPerfectNum(496) ➞ true

```

> ### 2. Abundant Number 
An abundant number or **excessive** number is a number `n`  which the sum-of-divisors `s` are satisfied the condition: `s` > `2n`

```js
isAbundantNum(27) ➞ false

isAbundantNum(24) ➞ true

isAbundantNum(97) ➞ false

isAbundantNum(100) ➞ true

```

> ### 3. Amicable Numbers

Amicable numbers are a pair of numbers with the following property: the sum of all of the proper divisors of the first number (not including itself) exactly equals the **second number** while the sum of all of the proper divisors of the second number (not including itself) likewise equals the **first number**.
```js
isAmicable(220,284) ➞ true
// First we find the proper divisors of 220:

// 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110

// Now find the proper divisors of 284:

// 1, 2, 4, 71, 142
```

> ### 4. Triangular Number Sequence

This Triangular Number Sequence is generated from a pattern of dots that form a triangle. The first 5 numbers of the sequence, or dots, are: `1, 3, 6, 10, 15` . Write a function that converts n number of places with its corresponding number.

```js
getTriangular(5) ➞ [1,3,6,10,15]

```

> ### 5. Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers

Given a positive integer `num` , return the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers that are less than or equal to `num` .

The first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are `1` and `1` . Every additional number in the sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers. The first six numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8.

For example, `sumFibs(10)` should return 10 because all odd Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to 10 are `1` , `1` , `3` , and `5` .

``` javascript
function sumFibs(num) {
    return num;
}
sumFibs(4000000); //4613732
```


> ### 6. Find the Longest Word in a String

Return the length of the longest word in the provided sentence.
Your response should be a number.

``` javascript
function findLongestWordLength(str) {
    return str.length;
}
findLongestWordLength("The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"); //6 - jumped
```

> ### 7. Panlindrome checker

Complete the function to return `true` if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return `false` .

A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.

I'll pass strings with varying formats, such as `"racecar"` , `"RaceCar"` , and `"race CAR"` among others.

We'll also pass strings with special symbols, such as `"2A3*3a2"` , `"2A3 3a2"` , and `"2_A3*3#A2"` .

``` javascript
function palindrome(str) {
    return true;
}
palindrome("eye"); //true
```
