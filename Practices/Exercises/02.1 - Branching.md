> ### 1. Special two-digit-number

A special two-digit number is a number such that when the sum of the digits of the number is added to the product of its digits, the result is equal to the original two-digit number.
```js
special2digits(19) ➞ true

special2digits(20) ➞ false

```

> ### 2. Narcissistic numbers

By definition, a narcissistic number is full of itself. A narcissistic number is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.
Only 3-digit numbers are considerated
```js
isNarcissistic(153) ➞ true
// 153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153

```

> ### 3. Quadratic expression Calculate
Take a b c as arguments then solve Quadratic Expression, print delta's status & solution(s)

<img src="https://www.gstatic.com/education/formulas/images_long_sheet/en/quadratic_equation.svg">

```js
quadratic(1,-2,1 ) ➞ '1'
quadratic(1,-5,6 ) ➞ '2 and 3'
quadratic(1,5,6 ) ➞ '-2 and -3'
quadratic(1,5,6 ) ➞ 'No solution'
```


> ### 4. Triangle and Parallelogram Area Finder
Write a function that accepts base (decimal), height (decimal) and shape ("triangle", "parallelogram") as input and calculates the area of that shape.

```js
areaShape(2, 3, "triangle") ➞ 3

areaShape(8, 6, "parallelogram") ➞ 48

areaShape(2.9, 1.3, "parallelogram") ➞ 3.77
```
**Notes**  
Area of a triangle is 0.5 * b * h   
Area of a parallelogram is b * h   
Assume triangle and parallelogram are the only inputs for shape.  

> ### 5. Is the Word Singular or Plural?
Create a function that takes in a word and determines whether or not it is plural. A plural word is one that ends in "s".

```js
isPlural("changes") ➞ true

isPlural("change") ➞ false

isPlural("dudes") ➞ true

isPlural("magic") ➞ false
```

**Notes**  
Don't forget to return the result.   
Remember that return true (boolean) is not the same as return "true" (string).  
This is an oversimplification of the English language. We are ignoring edge cases like "goose" and "geese", "fungus" and "fungi", etc.   

> ### 6. The pH Scale

Given a pH value, return whether that value is "alkaline" (greater than 7), "acidic" (less than 7), or "neutral" (7). Return "invalid" if the value given is less than 0 or greater than 14.


```js
pHName(5) ➞ "acidic"

pHName(8.7) ➞ "alkaline"

pHName(7) ➞ "neutral"
```

**Notes**

Values such as 6.9999 and 8.00001 should return "acidic" and "alkaline" respectively.
