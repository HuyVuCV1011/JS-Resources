> ### 1. Special two-digit-number
>
> A special two-digit number is a number such that when the sum of the digits of the number is added to the product of its digits, the result is equal to the original two-digit number.
```js
special2digits(19) ➞ true

special2digits(20) ➞ false

```

> ### 2. Narcissistic numbers
>
> By definition, a narcissistic number is full of itself. A narcissistic number is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.
Only 3-digit numbers are considerated
```js
isNarcissistic(153) ➞ true
// 153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153

```

> ### 3. Quadratic expression Calculate
>
> Take *a*, *b*, *c* as arguments then solve Quadratic Expression, print delta's status & solution(s)
>
> <img src="https://www.gstatic.com/education/formulas/images_long_sheet/en/quadratic_equation.svg">

```js
quadratic(1,-2,1 ) ➞ '1'
quadratic(1,-5,6 ) ➞ '2 and 3'
quadratic(1,5,6 ) ➞ '-2 and -3'
quadratic(1,5,6 ) ➞ 'No solution'
```


> ### 4. Triangle and Parallelogram Area Finder
>
> Write a function that accepts base (decimal), height (decimal) and shape ("triangle", "parallelogram") as input and calculates the area of that shape.

```js
areaShape(2, 3, "triangle") ➞ 3

areaShape(8, 6, "parallelogram") ➞ 48

areaShape(2.9, 1.3, "parallelogram") ➞ 3.77
```
**Notes**  
Area of a triangle is 0.5 * b * h   
Area of a parallelogram is b * h   
Assume triangle and parallelogram are the only inputs for shape.  


> ### 5. The pH Scale
> 
> Given a pH value, return whether that value is "alkaline" (greater than 7), "acidic" (less than 7), or "neutral" (7). Return "invalid" if the value given is less than 0 or greater than 14.


```js
pHName(5) ➞ "acidic"

pHName(8.7) ➞ "alkaline"

pHName(7) ➞ "neutral"
```

**Notes**

Values such as 6.9999 and 8.00001 should return "acidic" and "alkaline" respectively.

> ### 6. Automorphic Numbers
> 
> A number n is automorphic if n^2 ends in n.
> 
> For example: n=_5_, n^2=2*5*
> 
> Create a function that takes a number and returns true if the number is automorphic, false if it isn't.

```js

isAutomorphic(5) ➞ true

isAutomorphic(8) ➞ false

isAutomorphic(76) ➞ true
```



> ### 7. Last Digit Ultimate
>
> Your job is to create a function, that takes 3 numbers: a, b, c and returns true if (the last digit of a \* the last digit of b) = the last digit of c. Check the examples below for an explanation.

```js
lastDig(25, 21, 125) ➞ true
// The last digit of 25 is 5, the last digit of 21 is 1, and the last
// digit of 125 is 5, and the last digit of 5*1 = 5, which is equal
// to the last digit of 125(5).

lastDig(55, 226, 5190) ➞ true
// The last digit of 55 is 5, the last digit of 226 is 6, and the last
// digit of 5190 is 0, and the last digit of 5*6 = 30 is 0, which is
// equal to the last digit of 5190(0).

lastDig(12, 215, 2142) ➞ false
// The last digit of 12 is 2, the last digit of 215 is 5, and the last
// digit of 2142 is 2, and the last digit of 2*5 = 10 is 0, which is
// not equal to the last digit of 2142(2).

```

Notes:
If you still don't understand:  
The last digit of a = `x`, the last digit of `b` = `y`, and the last digit of `c` = `z`.
Return true if `x*y = z`, and false otherwise.  
Numbers can be negative.



> ### 8. Is the Word Singular or Plural?
> 
> Create a function that takes in a word and determines whether or not it is plural. A plural word is one that ends in "s".

```js
isPlural("changes") ➞ true

isPlural("change") ➞ false

isPlural("dudes") ➞ true

isPlural("magic") ➞ false
```

**Notes**  
Don't forget to return the result.   
Remember that return true (boolean) is not the same as return "true" (string).  
This is an oversimplification of the English language. We are ignoring edge cases like "goose" and "geese", "fungus" and "fungi", etc.   


> ### 9. factorialDivisible

Create a function that takes a number **n** and the expression **L = (n - 1)! + 1 = 1 _ 2 _ 3 ... \* (n-1) + 1** please determine if **L** is divisible by **n**

```js
// with n is 3
factorialDivisible(n); // return true
// explain: L = 2! + 1 = 1*2 + 1 = 3 divisible by 3.

// with n is 5
factorialDivisible(n); // return true
// explain: L = 4! + 1 = 1*2*3*4 + 1 = 25 divisible by 5.

// with n is 4
factorialDivisible(n); // return false
// explain: L = 3! + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7 divisible by 4.

```
