## Objects, Arrays and Classes 
They are reference **type** of values
> ### Object 
Object is a list containing a lot of properties.Here is a property

<img src="../sources/ObjectProperty.png" >

Property is similar to binding (variable). They have name and value, seperated by comma. You can get value of properties through its name and `.` (dot) operator or `[` and `]` (brackets) operator

```js
let myobj={
    name:"son",
    age:11,
    crush:{
        name:"some one",
        age:11
    },
    favorites:["cat","dog"]
}
myobj.name                     // "son:
myobj.crush                    // {name:"some one",age:11}
myobj.crush.name               // "some one"

myobj["name"]                  // "son:
myobj['crush']                 // {name:"some one",age:11}
myobj['crush']['name']         // "some one"
```

> ### Array
Array is a list containing a lot of values.You can access to the i-th value its index and `[` `]` (brackets) operator. Index of arrays always start at `0`
```js
let myarr = ["son","linh","tram","quang",[11,12]]

myarr[0]                 // "son"
myarr[4][1]              // 12
// length is 5
```
Of course, array has properties too. One of them is `length` and it will give you length of the array.
> ### Classes    
In programming culture, we have a thing called object-oriented programming, a set of techniques that use objects (and related concepts) as the central principle of program organization.


> ### Method
Remember function? Function some how is special-type of value. So it can be an value. If a function belongs to objects, it will be had a name **method**. Methods are nothing more than properties that hold function values. This is a simple method:
```js
let myobj={
    name:"son",
    age:11,
    crush:{
        name:"some one",
        age:11
    },
   say:()=>{
       console.log("i am son")
   }
```

> ### Prototype 
In addition to objects set of properties, most of them also have a prototype. A prototype is another object that is used as a fallback source of properties.

> ### Constructor
JavaScript’s prototype system can be interpreted as a somewhat informal take on an object-oriented concept called classes. A class defines the *shape* of object — what methods and properties it has. Such an object is called an ***instance*** of the class.  

Prototypes are useful for defining **properties** for which all instances of a class share the same value. Properties or methods sometimes that differ per instance.

To create an **instance**, constructor is an easy choice.
```js
class Rabbit {
    constructor(type) {
        this.type = type; 
    }
    speak(line) {
        console.log(`The ${this.type} rabbit says '${line}'`);
    } 
}
let brownRabbit = new Rabbit("brown")
brownRabbit.speak("bru bruhhh!!!!")
```

Object properties can be override per instance. Existed properties will be hidden.
```js
brownRabbit.speak = ()=>{ console.log("nani??????")}
brownRabbit.speak() //nani
Rabbit.prototype.speak() // The undefined rabbit says 'undefined'
```
