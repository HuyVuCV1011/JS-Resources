## Document Object Model
Javascript is created for adding mobility to our web interface (front end). Javascript can listen, add, remove, change the content, which represents to the user. Javascript supports developer in reacting to user behavior through **D**ocument **O**bject **M**odel

"""  
The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web. In this guide, we'll briefly introduce the DOM. We'll look at how the DOM represents an HTML or XML document in memory and how you use APIs to create web content and applications.  
"""
> ### DOM document
An object with global scope, represents entire your document inteface(HTML + CSS + JS )
```js 
console.log(document)
```
> ### DOM element/Node

Each HTML tag can be represented as an `element`. Often, with JavaScript, you want to manipulate HTML elements. A `node` also can be represented as HTML `element`, but more than that, a node can be an text, comment, or something else.

> ### DOM HTML/CSS
Element is an object, and it have methods and attributes. These concept help us to modify HTML attribute and CSS such as
```js
document.write("aaaaaaaaaaa") // replace all html ontent to "aaaaaaaaaaa"
document.getElementById("p2").style.color = "blue"; // add declaration "color: blue" to style attribute of html element having id = p2
``` 
> ### DOM Event/Listener
A JavaScript block of code can be executed when an ***event*** occurs, like when a user clicks on an HTML element.

```js
document.getElementById("myBtn").addEventListener("click", displayDate) // when user do click stuff on HTML element with id = myBtn then displayDate function is invoked
```

> ### DOM Collections/NodeLists

The `getElementsByTagName()` method returns an HTMLCollection object.We can iterate through all element in this collection using `for` or `while`. Collection is similar to array but actually not.
```js
let myCollection = document.getElementsByTagName("p");
let i;
for (i = 0; i < myCollection.length; i++) {
  myCollection[i].style.color = "red";
}
```
> ### DOM Animation/Navigation
The nodes in the node tree have a hierarchical relationship to each other.

The terms parent, child, and sibling are used to describe the relationships.

In a node tree, the top node is called the root (or root node)
Every node has exactly one parent, except the root (which has no parent)
A node can have a number of children
Siblings (brothers or sisters) are nodes with the same parent


Navigating Between Nodes
You can use the following node properties to navigate between nodes with JavaScript:

- parentNode
- childNodes[nodenumber]
- firstChild
- lastChild
- nextSibling
- previousSibling
