### Control the Flows 
When your program contains more than one statement, the statements are executed as if they are a story, from top to bottom.
```js
let a = "somebody";
console.log(a);
a = 'Ricardo'
console.log("hello "+a)
// > somebody 
// > hello Ricardo
```
> ### if 

> ### if - else

> ### switch - case

> ### for

> ### while

> ### do - while

> ### ```break```

> ### Why ```for``` loop is better?
