## Values, Types, Operators and Expressions 

> ### Values
```js
60
"hello"
"lorem ipsum ..."
```
Value is infomation. And our mission are deal with infomation.
> ### Types
Each value has an type that determine its rule.
```js
60                    // number
"hello"               // string
"lorem ipsum ..."     // string
```

We can divide types into 2 kind : 
 - primal: *string*, *boolean*, *number*
 - non-primal (aka reference): *object*, *number*, *user-defined* 
> ### Operators 
Values can interact with values through operators. For example:  
You can add `2` and `3` to create new values `5`. Almost operators are similar to math operators (symbols ).  

Not all operators are symbols. Some are written as words. One example is the `typeof` operator, which produces a string value naming the type of the value you give it. But some operators need 2 values to generate new values such as +, -, * , /,..  (identity and equality)

In summary, operators that use two values are called *binary* operators, while those that take one are called *unary* operators.  

> ### Expressions   
Values combination using operators are expressions. For example,
```js
2 + 3 + 5           // 10
"hello " + "world!" // "hello world!"
```
When using operators, we must know which operator was execute first, such as
```js
2*3 + 3**2 /4 // 8.25 
```
